		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 lb. chicken wings</li>
			<li>2 tbsp. Vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
			<li>Kosher salt</li>
			<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1/4 c. hot sauce r</li>
			<li>2 tbsp. honey</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat oven to 400° and place a wire rack over a baking sheet. In a
				large bowl, toss chicken wings with oil and season with garlic powder,
				salt, and pepper. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake until chicken is golden and skin is crispy, 50 to 60 minutes,
				flipping the wings halfway through.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a small saucepan, whisk together hot sauce and honey. Bring to simmer
				then stir in butter. Cook until butter is melted and slightly reduced,
				about 2 minutes. Heat broiler on low. Transfer baked wings to a bowl and
				toss with buffalo sauce until completely coated. Return wings to rack
				and broil—watching carefully!—until sauce caramelizes, 3 minutes. Serve
				with ranch dressing and vegetables.
			</li>
